<document/> is the full text, and <chunk/> is the target segment.

Formulate a concise (1-2 sentences) context that seamlessly integrates this chunk into the document, highlighting essential concepts for search retrieval. For technical content, include crucial terms, applications, and connections, using concrete examples for complex theories. For narratives, summarize main events, characters, and links. For philosophical and abstract concepts, describe their real-world implications or cultural context. For implicit or inferred relationships, explicitly state the connection between the chunk and the document, providing evidence. For contrasting information, explain the discrepancy and its significance. For ambiguous or nuanced content, provide a clear interpretation and its relevance or implications. For political rhetoric, identify underlying implications and their potential impact. For complex sentence structures or indirect relationships, simplify and clarify without losing meaning.

Address specific content types: interpret complex theories by linking them to concrete examples, summarize legal cases by the main legal issue and ethical dilemma, explain financial instruments by their purpose and regulatory relevance, discuss historical events by their primary cause and long-term effect, and describe medical conditions by specific patient behaviors.

Ensure the generated context accurately places the chunk within the larger document, emphasizing key concepts that define the chunk's relevance and its influence on the overall narrative. The context should be adaptable, easily understandable, concise, and relevant to the document's context, even when handling implicit or inferred relationships.

<document/> is the full text, and <chunk/> is the target segment.

Craft a concise (1-2 sentences) context that integrates this chunk into the document, emphasizing key concepts for search retrieval. For technical content, include crucial terms, applications, and connections, using concrete examples for complex theories and specific examples for ambiguous scenarios. For narratives, summarize main events, characters, and links. For philosophical and abstract concepts, describe real-world implications or cultural context. For implicit or inferred relationships, explicitly state the connection between the chunk and the document, providing clear evidence or examples. For contrasting information, explain the discrepancy and its significance, while for ambiguous or nuanced content, provide a clear interpretation and its relevance or implications. For political rhetoric, identify underlying implications and their potential impact. For complex sentence structures or indirect relationships, simplify and clarify without losing meaning.

Address specific content types: interpret complex theories by linking them to concrete examples, summarize legal cases by the main legal issue and ethical dilemma, explain financial instruments by their purpose and regulatory relevance, discuss historical events by their primary cause and long-term effect, and describe medical conditions by specific patient behaviors. Ensure the generated context accurately places the chunk within the larger document, highlighting key concepts that define the chunk's relevance and its influence on the overall narrative. The context should be adaptable, easily understandable, concise, and relevant to the document's context, even when handling implicit or inferred relationships, by providing clear evidence or examples.

Keep the generated context concise and adaptable to various content types, including specialized vocabulary and edge cases. Specifically, for complex topics (e.g., neuroscience, AI, climate change, quantum mechanics, immunology), ensure accurate interpretation of connections to nuanced dilemmas, using appropriate terminology and clear language to explain subtleties and ambiguities.
Test Cases: [{'name': 'Test case - Testing interpretation of complex neuroscience and its connections to nuanced ethical dilemmas in a multi-layered scenario with indirect context, specialized vocabulary, and edge cases', 'PAGE_CONTENT': "In the intricate field of 'neuroscience', 'deep brain stimulation' (DBS) and 'neurofeedback' (NF) are emerging as promising techniques for 'self-regulation' and 'neuroplasticity', with potential applications in treating 'neurodegenerative disorders' such as 'Parkinson's disease', 'Alzheimer's disease', and 'dementia'. However, the use of these techniques also raises ethical concerns, particularly in the context of 'cognitive enhancement', where some argue that relying on DBS or NF could lead to 'neurological dependency', potentially impacting an individual's 'autonomy' to control their mental states. On the other hand, proponents highlight the benefits of these technologies, such as 'empowerment', 'self-awareness', and 'improved mental health', while emphasizing the importance of 'informed consent' and 'ethical guidelines' in their use. Moreover, the emergence of 'off-label uses', such as 'performance enhancement' for non-medical purposes, blurs the line between therapeutic and recreational use, raising further ethical questions.", 'CHUNK_CONTENT': "The neuroscientist's presentation on DBS and NF was criticized for its 'lack of consideration for potential misuse' and 'overemphasis on therapeutic applications'.", 'expected': ['cognitive enhancement', 'neurological dependency', 'autonomy', 'informed consent', 'ethical guidelines'], 'unexpected': ['neuroplasticity', "alzheimer's", 'dementia', 'performance enhancement', 'off-label uses', 'criticized', 'was', 'of', 'and', 'this', 'lack', 'overemphasis', 'on', 'consideration', 'for', 'potential', 'misuse', 'therapeutic', 'applications']}, {'name': 'Test case - Testing interpretation of complex artificial intelligence and its connections to nuanced ethical dilemmas in an ambiguous, multi-layered scenario with subtle relationships, implicit context, and contrasting information', 'PAGE_CONTENT': "In the realm of 'artificial intelligence' (AI), 'machine learning' (ML) algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, enabling 'deep learning' models to outperform humans in tasks such as 'image recognition', 'natural language processing', and 'board games'. However, the application of AI also raises ethical concerns, particularly in the context of 'algorithmic bias', where AI systems may perpetuate or exacerbate existing societal biases, leading to 'discrimination' against certain groups. The 'Explainable AI' (XAI) movement advocates for the development of AI systems that are transparent, interpretable, and accountable, but its implementation is challenged by the 'black-box' nature of deep learning models.
