[{'name': 'Test case - Testing understanding of advanced quantum physics concepts and their application in a highly challenging, multi-layered scenario with implicit context, domain-specific jargon, and edge cases', 'PAGE_CONTENT': "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the other particles, even when they are separated by large distances. This phenomenon, which was famously described by Albert Einstein as 'spooky action at a distance,' is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has been experimentally confirmed in various systems, including photons, atoms, and even macroscopic objects. However, the nature of quantum entanglement is still not fully understood, and it raises profound questions about the nature of reality, causality, and information transmission. One of the most intriguing applications of quantum entanglement is in the field of quantum computing, where entangled qubits can be used to perform complex calculations that would be infeasible for classical computers.", 'CHUNK_CONTENT': 'A team of quantum physicists is discussing the potential of a specific quantum phenomenon for use in a new type of computing system, aiming to overcome the limitations of existing technologies.', 'expected': ['quantum entanglement', 'entangled qubits', 'quantum computing'], 'unexpected': ['Albert Einstein', 'spooky action at distance', 'photons', 'atoms', 'macroscopic objects', 'nature of quantum entanglement', 'causality', 'information transmission']}, {'name': 'Test case - Testing understanding of complex environmental policies and their implications in a multi-stakeholder scenario with contrasting information', 'PAGE_CONTENT': "The Paris Agreement is an international treaty aimed at combating climate change and its impacts. It seeks to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and preferably to 1.5°C, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this, countries must submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outlining their emission reduction targets and strategies. However, the agreement also recognizes the importance of adaptation measures, technology development, and financing, particularly for developing countries. The agreement emphasizes the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,' acknowledging that developed countries have contributed more to historical emissions and should take the lead in addressing climate change.", 'CHUNK_CONTENT': 'A developing country is considering its options for future economic growth while adhering to the Paris Agreement.', 'expected': ['Nationally Determined Contributions', 'emission reduction targets', 'common but differentiated responsibilities', 'financing', 'adaptation measures'], 'unexpected': ['Paris Agreement', 'global warming', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'climate change', 'multi-stakeholder scenario']}, {'name': 'Test case - Testing understanding of advanced biotechnology concepts and their application in a highly challenging, multi-layered scenario with implicit context, domain-specific jargon, and edge cases', 'PAGE_CONTENT': 'CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene-editing tool that enables precise modifications to DNA sequences. It consists of two main components: the Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a pair of molecular scissors to cut DNA, and a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs Cas9 to the target sequence through complementary base pairing. The system was adapted from a naturally occurring bacterial defense mechanism against viruses. However, CRISPR-Cas9 can also be used in conjunction with other genetic elements, such as donor DNA templates for homology-directed repair (HDR) or cytosine deaminases for base editing, to achieve specific genetic modifications.

However, neuroplasticity can also contribute to the development and progression of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, where abnormal neural connections can lead to seizures.

However, graphene's lack of a bandgap limits its applicability in digital electronics. To address this, researchers have developed various methods to engineer a bandgap in graphene, such as bilayer graphene, graphene nanoribbons, and graphene quantum dots. These methods introduce new challenges, such as controlling the size and shape of nanostructures and maintaining the intrinsic properties of graphene.", 'CHUNK_CONTENT': 'A team of materials scientists is working on a project to modify graphene for use in digital electronics, aiming to overcome a specific limitation of its natural state.', 'expected': ['bandgap', 'graphene nanoribbons', 'digital electronics', 'electrical conductivity'], 'unexpected': ['thermal conductivity', 'mechanical strength', 'optical transparency', 'bilayer graphene', 'graphene quantum dots']}]
